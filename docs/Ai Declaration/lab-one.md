University of the Witwatersrand   Starting a Project   COMS3011A Lab 1

## Brendan Griffiths


## 1   Starting a Project


## Due date : 4 August 2026


## 1.1   Brief

Build a todo application using Next.js and SQLite.

The application is local-first. It will not be deployed to the web; a user downloads it and runs it locally

via Node.js, npm or equivalent. There are no user accounts — the application serves a single user on the

machine it runs on.


## A full feature list:

•   The user can create, edit and archive tasks.

‣   Each task carries the following information: Title, Description, Due Date, Topic.

‣   A task cannot be deleted, only archived, so that it remains viewable.

•   The user can view their tasks as a list, sortable by topic, by status and by due date.

•   Each task has one of three statuses: Todo, In-Progress, Complete. These are fixed; they are not user-

customisable.

•   A task that is overdue must be indicated in some way, but not as a status.

•   If the application is restarted, all information persists.


## Requirements:

•   The repository must contain at least three tests that exercise real behaviour, runnable by a single

documented command.

•   The repository must contain documentation, as markdown, specifying:

‣   Third-Party Code   — the libraries and packages you installed, and one line on why each was

chosen.

‣   Database Design   — the tables and the relationships between them.

‣   Running It   — the Node version and the exact commands to install, run and test the application,

such that a reader can start it from a clean clone with nothing else to hand.


## 1.2   Submission

•   The link to the GitHub repository.

•   The documentation files.

•   Transcripts of AI usage — planning, code generation, debugging.

## 1.3   Marking

Total: 100 marks. The functional walkthrough (28) is scored from the fixed checklist below. The

remaining 72 marks are scored on the three-level rubric; level 1 awards half the stated weight.


## 1.3.1   Functional walkthrough (28 marks)

Performed from a clean clone, in this order. Each step is 4 marks, awarded pass/fail with no partial

credit. Cosmetic defects are not penalised here.

1.   The application installs and starts by following the README alone.

2.   A task can be created carrying all four fields, and appears in the list.

3.   An existing task can be edited, and the change survives a page reload.

4.   A task can be archived; it leaves the active list but remains viewable.

5.   The list sorts by topic, by status, and by due date.

6.   A task whose due date has passed is visibly flagged, and overdue is not one of the three selectable

statuses.

7.   The application is stopped and restarted; all data persists.

A submission that fails step 1 is given one further attempt of at most ten minutes, after which the

walkthrough scores zero and marking proceeds from the repository alone.


## 1.3.2   Rubric (72 marks)

Criteria   Weight   0 — Absent   1 — Partial   2 — Complete


## Documentation   18   Missing, or one of the three

required sections is absent.


## All three sections present, but at


## least one is a bare list —


## dependencies named without


## justification, or a database


## section that does not describe


## the relationships — or the run


## instructions omit a step needed

to start the application.


## All three specific and accurate:


## each dependency with a stated


## reason; tables and relationships


## matching the shipped schema;


## run instructions that name the


## Node version and every


## command required, verified

against a clean clone.

Commit history   18   Fewer than six commits, or a


## history dominated by bulk


## dumps — the whole application

arriving in one or two commits.


## Work is split into commits, but


## messages are largely


## uninformative (“fix”, “update”,


## “wip”), or the timestamps show


## the entire project committed in a

single sitting.


## At least six commits, each a


## coherent slice that leaves the


## repository in a working state,


## with messages stating what


## changed and why where the


## reason is not obvious from the


## diff. Work is visibly spread over

more than one session.

Database design   16   No schema file or migrations;


## task data held in memory, in a


## JSON file, or otherwise not in


## SQLite; archived tasks deleted

outright.


## A schema exists and persists


## tasks, but at least one decision is


## unsound: overdue stored as a


## column or status value rather


## than derived, archive


## implemented by copying rows


## elsewhere, or the topic and


## status fields modelled


## inconsistently with the

documented design.


## A schema that a reader could


## work from: sensible column


## types and constraints, archive


## represented as a flag or


## timestamp on the task, overdue


## derived at read time from the


## due date and status, and the


## shipped schema matching what

the documentation claims.


## Testing   12   No tests, or tests that assert


## nothing — render-only smoke

tests, tautological assertions.


## Three or more tests exist and


## assert something real, but they


## do not run from the documented


## command, or they depend on the


## developer’s own database file

and its contents.


## Three or more tests exercising


## real behaviour, including at least


## one that covers archiving or the


## overdue rule. They are


## deterministic, run against a


## throwaway database, and pass

Criteria   Weight   0 — Absent   1 — Partial   2 — Complete


## from the single documented

command.


## AI usage   8   No transcripts, or transcripts


## showing whole-project


## generation with no input beyond

the brief.


## Task-level use with stated


## constraints, but no instance of


## the author rejecting, correcting

or constraining an output.


## Constraints stated up front, and


## at least one clear instance of the


## author identifying an unsuitable


## or incorrect output and


## redirecting it. Decisions visible


## in the transcript are traceable to

the shipped code.
