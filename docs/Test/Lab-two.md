The Code   Blitz:   ninety minutes, the whole application

You took two weeks over Lab 1. Today you have ninety minutes, and you are going to ship something several

times its size — because you will be driving an agentic IDE rather than typing.


## O N B O A R D I N G


## 45   min


## B U I L D   T I M E


## 90   min


## F E A T U R E   T A R G E T


## 50   pts


## T O T A L   M A R K S


## 70

Demonstration:   on your own machine, during the session. You show; the demonstrator marks what they

see.


## 2.1   Brief

You are going to build the todo application from Lab 1 again.

Same stack:   Next.js and SQLite , local-first, no accounts, a single user on the machine it runs on. Same rules as Lab 1

— a task cannot be deleted, only archived; the three statuses are fixed; overdue is derived, never stored; everything

survives a restart.

Start from an   empty project . Do not open your Lab 1 work. The first twenty minutes of this lab rebuild all of Lab 1

from nothing, and that is the point: the work that took you a fortnight is now a checkpoint you clear before the real

exercise begins.


## 2.2   How the ninety minutes run

C L O C K   C H E C K P O I N T   B E F O R E   Y O U   M O V E   O N

0 – 20   Core.   The whole Lab 1 application, running: every item in the Core

area of the feature menu.


## It runs, and you can create and

archive a task.

20 – 90   Blitz.   Work the feature menu, one feature at a time. Finish and

check each one before starting the next.


## The application still runs and the tests

still pass.


## T H E   H A R D   R U L E

At the buzzer you demonstrate whatever is running. There is no time to fix things during the demonstration.

Integrate continuously. Do not have four agent tasks in flight at minute 88.


## 2.3   The feature menu

The   Core   area is required and is marked separately. The other six areas are in no particular order and of no particular

difficulty — pick whatever combination interests you. Nothing is gained by spreading across areas or by staying inside

one.


---

Beyond Core, claim features totalling   at least 50 points . Points beyond 50 earn no extra marks, but they are useful

insurance: if a feature is judged partial or rejected at the demonstration, the overflow covers it.

Each entry states what   done   means. That sentence is the bar:

Full points   — the   Done when   condition is met, in front of the demonstrator.

Half points   — the feature is there and does something real, but the   Done when   condition is not met.

Nothing   — absent, broken, or not reachable from the UI (or, for the interop area, from a documented command).

Anything claimed must also survive a restart of the application.

C O R E   —   §   2 . 5   required, marked separately — this is Lab 1, and it earns no feature points


## C O D E   P T S   F E A T U R E


## CA 1   REQ   Create a task

carrying Title, Description, Due Date and Topic, which then appears in the list.

D O N E   W H E N   all four fields are captured and visible afterwards.


## CA 2   REQ   Edit a task

, so that the change outlives the process.

D O N E   W H E N   you edit a task, stop the application, start it again, and the change is still there.


## CA 3   REQ   Archive a task

, never delete one. It leaves the active list but remains viewable.

D O N E   W H E N   an archived task is still findable, and nothing in the application removes a row.


## CA 4   REQ   Sort the list

by topic, by status and by due date.

D O N E   W H E N   all three orderings work and are correct, not merely offered.


## CA 5   REQ   Flag overdue tasks

, derived from the due date rather than stored, and never as a fourth status. The three statuses are Todo, In-

Progress and Complete, and they are fixed.

D O N E   W H E N   a past-due task is visibly marked and   overdue   does not appear in the status selector.


## D A T A   A N D   S C H E M A


## C O D E   P T S   F E A T U R E

DS 1   6   Subtasks.

A task can contain child tasks, to any depth. The parent shows aggregate progress derived from its children

rather than a separately stored figure, and archiving a parent handles its children coherently — whichever rule

you choose, be ready to say why.

D O N E   W H E N   a three-level tree exists, ticking a leaf moves the root’s progress, and the tree survives a restart.


---


## C O D E   P T S   F E A T U R E

DS 2   5   Tags.

Free-form labels, many per task and many tasks per label, stored as a proper join rather than a comma-

separated string. Includes creating, renaming, colouring and deleting a tag, and filtering by several at once.

D O N E   W H E N   renaming a tag updates every task carrying it, and a two-tag filter returns the intersection.

DS 3   4   Projects.

A grouping one level above topic — a task belongs to at most one project — with a per-project view showing its

tasks and completion.

D O N E   W H E N   a project page lists only its own tasks and reports a progress figure that changes as they complete.

DS 4   8   Dependencies.

A task can be blocked by one or more others. The UI shows what is blocking a task and what it blocks, a task is

not startable while blocked, and an attempt to create a cycle is refused with a message naming the offending

path.

D O N E   W H E N   A → B → C → A is rejected on the attempt, not after the fact, and completing B visibly unblocks C.

DS 5   8   Recurrence.

Daily, weekly, monthly and a custom interval. Completing an instance closes it and creates the next at the

correct date; the series can be edited or ended without destroying past instances.

D O N E   W H E N   a monthly task due on the 31st produces a sensible next date in February, and completing an

instance leaves the completed one visible in history.

DS 6   3   Priority and effort.

A fixed priority scale (P0–P3) and an effort estimate, both filterable and sortable, and both surfaced in the list

without opening a task.

D O N E   W H E N   sorting by priority then due date gives a stable, correct order.


## I N P U T   A N D   S E A R C H


## C O D E   P T S   F E A T U R E

IS 1   8   Natural-language quick add.

One text box that parses a sentence into a full task:

su b mit   report   next   frid a y   5 pm   # c oms 3011   ! p 1   every   week   sets title, due date, topic, priority and

recurrence. A live preview shows the parsed result before it is saved, and unparsed text stays in the title rather

than being silently dropped.

D O N E   W H E N   three different phrasings of a relative date all resolve correctly, and the preview updates as you

type.

IS 2   7   Filter query language.

A search box accepting a real query syntax —   is : overdue   topi c : a lgorithms   due : < 2026-08-20   t a g : re a ding

— with a parser, support for negation and at least one boolean operator, and an error message that points at

the offending token rather than failing silently.

D O N E   W H E N   a malformed query produces a useful error and no results are silently wrong.


---


## C O D E   P T S   F E A T U R E

IS 3   5   Full-text search.

Search over title and description backed by SQLite FTS5 rather than a   LIKE   scan, returning ranked results

with the matching phrase highlighted in a snippet, and staying fast against the seed data.

D O N E   W H E N   a mid-word or multi-word phrase returns highlighted snippets, and the index is kept current when

a task is edited.

IS 4   5   Command palette.

C trl / C md - K   opens a single input that fuzzy-matches both commands (“archive task”, “switch to calendar”)

and tasks by title, executing on Enter, fully keyboard-driven.

D O N E   W H E N   an action and a specific task are both reachable in under five keystrokes without touching the

mouse.

IS 5   4   Keyboard-only operation.

Every action in the application — create, edit, status change, archive, navigate views — reachable without a

mouse, with visible focus at all times and a shortcut overlay on   ?   .

D O N E   W H E N   the entire Core walkthrough can be performed with the mouse untouched.


## V I E W S   A N D   I N T E R A C T I O N


## C O D E   P T S   F E A T U R E

VW 1   7   Kanban board.

The three statuses as columns, tasks as cards, drag between columns to change status. The change persists on

drop, the card renders its key fields, and the board respects the active filter.

D O N E   W H E N   a dragged card is in its new column after a reload, and a failed write reverts the card rather than

lying.

VW 2   7   Calendar.

Month and week views placing tasks on their due dates, with overdue and completed visually distinct,

navigation between periods, and drag-to-reschedule that writes the new due date.

D O N E   W H E N   dragging a task to another day changes its due date everywhere in the application, and a day with

many tasks degrades gracefully.

VW 3   4   Today view.

A single focused screen for someone about to start work: overdue first, then due today, then anything in

progress — ordered deliberately, and you can say why that order.

D O N E   W H E N   the view is empty-stated properly when there is nothing to do, rather than showing a blank panel.

VW 4   6   Timeline.

Tasks laid out horizontally against time, with bars spanning start to due date and arrows drawn between

dependent tasks, scrollable and zoomable across at least a month.

D O N E   W H E N   a dependency chain of three tasks is legible as a chain, not as three unrelated bars.


---


## C O D E   P T S   F E A T U R E

VW 5   4   Saved views.

A filter, sort and view-type combination the user can name, save, return to and delete, persisted in the

database rather than in browser storage.

D O N E   W H E N   a saved view is still there after a restart and reproduces exactly the list it was saved from.

VW 6   5   Scale.

The list stays responsive at 10,000 tasks — virtualised rendering, indexed queries, pagination or windowing at

the database level, and no full-table load into memory.

D O N E   W H E N   the seeded 10,000-row database scrolls smoothly and the list’s first paint is not visibly slower than

at 50 rows.


## T I M E   A N D   H I S T O R Y


## C O D E   P T S   F E A T U R E

TH 1   6   Activity log.

An append-only table recording every mutation — what changed, when, and the values before and after —

written in the same transaction as the change itself, never edited or deleted, and viewable as a reverse-

chronological feed.

D O N E   W H E N   every kind of mutation appears in the feed, and archiving a task adds a row rather than removing

any.

TH 2   7   Undo and redo.

C trl - Z   and   C trl - S hift - Z   across at least create, edit, archive and status change, reconstructed from the

activity log rather than from in-memory state, with a redo stack that clears correctly on a new action.

D O N E   W H E N   five mixed operations can be undone in order and redone back to where you started.

TH 3   4   Task history.

Per task, a readable account of what changed and when — field, old value, new value, timestamp — rather than

a raw event dump.

D O N E   W H E N   a task edited three times shows three legible entries, in order, naming the fields that changed.

TH 4   5   Statistics.

Completion over time as a chart, a per-day activity heatmap, current and longest streak, and a breakdown by

topic — all computed from real data, with the empty case handled.

D O N E   W H E N   the figures move correctly after completing a task, and a fresh database renders without crashing.

TH 5   4   Start dates and snooze.

A start date distinct from the due date, so a task can exist without yet being actionable, plus a snooze action

that pushes the start date forward. Not-yet-started tasks are hidden from Today but never from search.

D O N E   W H E N   a task starting tomorrow is absent from Today and present in the full list, and snoozing moves it.

## C O D E   P T S   F E A T U R E

IP 1   5   Import and export.

JSON, CSV and Markdown, both directions, round-trip safe — exporting a database and importing it into an

empty one reproduces it exactly, including archived tasks and relationships. Import reports what it rejected

rather than failing halfway.

D O N E   W H E N   an export-then-import cycle produces an identical row count in every table, and a malformed row

is reported by line.

IP 2   4   iCalendar export.

A   . i c s   file that a real calendar client can open or subscribe to, with correct field mapping and escaping, and

a documented URL or file path to hand to the client.

D O N E   W H E N   the file opens in an actual calendar application with the right titles on the right dates.

IP 3   5   Backup, restore and migrations.

A one-command backup and restore, plus versioned schema migrations that upgrade a database created by an

earlier build of your own application instead of dropping and recreating it.

D O N E   W H E N   a database made before your last few changes still opens under the current build with its data

intact.

IP 4   7   REST API with an OpenAPI 3 specification.

Full CRUD over HTTP with correct status codes and error bodies, described by a specification file that matches

the implemented routes, served as a browsable documentation page.

D O N E   W H E N   a request made from the docs page against the running application succeeds, and the spec has no

route the code lacks.

IP 5   5   CLI client.

npm   run   todo   a dd   " … "   ,   list   ,   done   and similar, driving the same core the web UI uses — one

implementation of the logic, not two — with output readable in a terminal and a non-zero exit code on failure.

D O N E   W H E N   a task added from the CLI appears in the running web UI, and the shared code path is identifiable.

IP 6   8   MCP server.

Expose your todo database as tools over the Model Context Protocol, so that an agent inside Qoder can list,

create and complete your tasks. Requires a tool schema, a documented way to connect it, and sane behaviour

when the agent sends nonsense.

D O N E   W H E N   you drive your own application by asking the agent, live, in front of the demonstrator.

## C O D E   P T S   F E A T U R E

QC 1   8   A test suite of twenty or more real tests.

Behaviour, not renders. Must include the awkward cases: recurrence across a month boundary, the timezone

at which a task becomes overdue, dependency cycle rejection, and archive semantics. Deterministic, and run

against a throwaway database from a single documented command.

D O N E   W H E N   the suite passes twice in a row and no test depends on the contents of your working database.


---


## C O D E   P T S   F E A T U R E

QC 2   6   End-to-end test.

A Playwright run that drives a real browser through the entire Core walkthrough — create, edit, restart,

archive, sort, overdue — and fails loudly when any step breaks.

D O N E   W H E N   it runs from one documented command and you can show it going red by breaking a feature.

QC 3   3   Seed script.

Generates several hundred plausible tasks with realistic titles, spread of due dates, topics, statuses and

relationships — enough to make the views and the scale work look like something.

D O N E   W H E N   one command produces a populated database and the data does not look like

Ta sk   1,   Ta sk   2,   Ta sk   3   .

QC 4   5   Accessibility pass.

Keyboard focus managed across dialogs and views, labels and roles on interactive elements, colour not the

only carrier of meaning, and a passing automated axe check wired into the test command.

D O N E   W H E N   the axe check runs from the test command and reports no violations on the main views.

QC 5   3   Appearance settings.

Dark mode and a density setting, honouring the system preference by default, overridable by the user, and

persisted across a restart.

D O N E   W H E N   the chosen theme survives a restart and neither mode has unreadable text anywhere.


## 2.4   Working with the agent

This lab is a conversation, not a dictation. The agent is excellent at execution and poor at guessing your intent, so most of

your ninety minutes is spent describing, reading what came back, and saying what was wrong with it. Some of this you

will have seen in the onboarding session; it is repeated here because it is what separates a working application at the

buzzer from a broken one.

Say the constraint before it is violated, not after.   The rules carried over from Lab 1 — overdue derived,

archive as a flag, three fixed statuses, nothing ever deleted — are exactly the ones an agent will break unprompted.

State them at the start of a task, and restate them whenever you open a new one.

Ask for one thing, then look.   A task you can check in thirty seconds is the right size. “Build the whole

application” is not a task, it is an abdication.

Push back in specifics.   “That’s wrong” gets you a different guess. “You stored   overdue   as a column; derive it

from   due _ d a te   at read time instead” gets you the fix. The quality of what you get out is set by the precision of what

you object to.

Slice into independent pieces.   Tags, the calendar view and the export format do not touch each other. Features

that all rewrite the task mutation path do. Run independent work concurrently; run the rest in sequence.

Run the tests after every feature.   The failure mode of a blitz is silent breakage four features back.

Read the output.   You are responsible for every line in the project, including the ones you did not type.

## 2.5   Marking

Total: 70 marks — Core 20, features 50. Everything is marked live, at your machine, from what you show.


## C O R E   —   2 0   M A R K S

The five Core features, 4 marks each, pass or fail with no partial credit. Cosmetic defects are not penalised. If the

application does not start, the whole lab scores zero.


## F E A T U R E S   —   5 0   M A R K S


## One point equals one mark, capped at 50:


## V E R D I C T   A W A R D

Yes   — meets its   Done when   condition   full points

Partial   — present and doing something real, but the   Done when   condition is not met   half points


## No   — absent, broken, or unreachable   nothing

overdue   stored as a column, or added as a fourth status. The Core area forbids both. ×

Archiving implemented as a   DELETE   , or by copying the row to another table. ×

Recurrence that produces 31 February, or drifts by an hour across a DST boundary. ×

Overdue computed against the server’s timezone rather than the user’s, so tasks flip at the

wrong midnight.


## ×

A list view that issues one query per task to fetch its tags. ×


## No index on the columns every query filters by. ×

Tests that mock the database and therefore assert only that the mocks were called. ×

A dependency graph walk with no cycle guard, which hangs the process on the first loop. ×

Migrations that drop and recreate tables, destroying existing data. ×

Three different libraries installed to do one job, because they were added by three separate

tasks.
